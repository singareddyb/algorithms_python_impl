To help me think in Python, I am implementing some basic algorithms.


Implementations of Algorithms
=============================================

[Fibonacci Numbers using Matrices]:
  An Implementation for generating fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time using Matrices.O(log n)

[Fractional Knapsack]:
  A Greedy implementation for filing up a knapsack with provided elements. Since the sorting algorithm chosen is insertion-sort, worst-case complexity leads to   an polynomial time - O(n^2).

[Multiplication of Numbers]:
  Multiplying two numbers in linear-time. O(log(n))

[Merge Sort]:
  Using a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to sort an unsorted list of elements. Complexity is - O(n*log(n)

[Quick Sort]:
  Using a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to sort an unsorted list of elements. Complexity is - 
  Average-case - O(n*log(n))
  Worst-case - O(n^2)

[Quick Sort 3-way partition]:
  Using a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to sort a list with a number of equal elements. Complexity is -
  Worst-case - O(n*log(n)) 

[Binary Search]:
  Using a Divide-and-Conquer strategy on an already sorted list, implementing a very basic algorithm for search through a list of elements and recursively        searching for the element. Search complexity is logarithmic again. O(log n)
